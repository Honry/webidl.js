WebIDLParser.js is, shockingly enough, a Javascript parser for WebIDL (http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/WebIDL/)

In order to use it in a Web context, simply include web/WebIDLParser.js. Note that this file has not been
minified and is quite large. I tested reducing its size here, and easily got it down to 44K minified and
6.4K gzipped (being generated, it is rather repetitive code). A "WebIDLParser" object will become available.

Using it from Node.js or a CommonJS environment is equally simple: just put node/WebIDLParser.js in your
library path and require it. It exports a "Parser" object.

The interface is simple: the only method you need to worry about is parse(str, [start]). It takes a string containing
WebIDL, and returns an AST expressed as a simple JS structure (utilities to traverse it more easily are
forthcoming). Optionally a second argument can specify which rule of the grammar to start with. This is useful
when parsing a small WebIDL fragment that may be incomplete. The names of the rules can be found in lib/grammar.peg.
Just so that you don't have to look, the most common start parameters are:

	- definitions (the default)
	- interface
	- Operation
	- Attribute
	- type
	- implements
	- typedef
	- exception

The grammar isn't exactly the one in the WebIDL draft. In some places it is slightly more permissive (not
by that much though), and its handling of extended attributes is simpler. It doesn't currently support
arrays because those weren't described in the draft's grammar, but I'll add them shortly.

If you wish modify the grammar, which is in lib/grammar.peg, go through the following steps:

	- read up on PEG.js at http://pegjs.majda.cz/
	- create a directory at the root of this repository called depends
	- inside depends, git clone git://github.com/dmajda/pegjs.git
	- then run node utils/generate.js to regenerate the JS
